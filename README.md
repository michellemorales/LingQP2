# LingQP2
QP2 = Second Qualifying Paper = an exam requirement for the Linguistics Department at the CUNY Graduate Center www.gc.cuny.edu/linguistics

The research focus of my QP2 was automatic depression detection from speech and text. I used the publicly available AVEC 2014 corpus of German speech (http://sspnet.eu/avec2014/). I was interested in feature development across the 2 modalities (e.g. speech and text). The features I developed and the experiments I conducted are described in:
