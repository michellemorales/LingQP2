# LingQP2
QP2 = Second Qualifying Paper = an exam requirement for the Linguistics Department at the CUNY Graduate Center

The research focus of my QP2 was automatic depression detection from speech and text. I used the publicly available AVEC 2014 corpus of German speech (http://sspnet.eu/avec2014/). I was interested in feature development across the 2 modalities (e.g. speech and text). The features I developed and the experiments I conducted are described in:

Michelle Morales & Rivka Levitan. 2016. Speech vs. Text: A Comparative Analsyis of Features for Depression Detection Systems. 2016 IEEE Workshop on Spoken Langauge Technology.
